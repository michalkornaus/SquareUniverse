Unity C# Voxel Game

Game needs a lot of optimizations but overall when not loading new chunks and heightmaps it runs pretty good.\
Both noise libraries are not mine and all credit goes to authors of them.\
For now I use original minecraft textures because this project is not commercial.\

When in Unity in-game you can press left mouse button to destroy blocks and right click to place them.\With numbers 1 to 7 on keyboard you can change blocks you want to place.
